<h1>Data science and machine learning resources for screen reader users</h1>

<h2>Project</h2>

In recent years, technologies such as data science and machine learning have been adopted in various fields.
In the future, there will be more and more opportunities to learn them from an early stage in various types of school education.
On the other hand, in order to acquire and utilize such technologies, it is essential to analyze huge amounts of data using graphs and other tools.
In this project, I would like to develop the necessary information and tools for screen reader users to learn these technologies by
relying on auditory information rather than visual information, in preparation for the future.
</br>
At present, I have developed two libraries: a library that notifies users of visual status changes on google colaboratory with sound, 
and an alternative library for plots that allows users to check graph data with sound. 
The objective is for screen reader users to be able to run through and understand some typical machine learning tutorials.

<h2>Libraries</h2>

I'm developing a variety of tools for Python programming on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colaboratory</a>, 
considering the ease of preparing a development environment and the relative accessibility of the environment.
I would like to consider Jupyter Notebook, which is often used in a similar situation, after the accessibility is expected to be improved in future.

<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<h3>Speech Command Recognition</h3>

The tutorial on learning voice command recognition by deep learning introduced on the PyTorch official website can be run in a screen reader.
